## IDLS Project

- The project is based on federated learning with 5 nodes and 1 centralized sync server.

- To run the code, simply run the python notebooks given in the repository above.
- All the python notebooks are also stored in the form of pdf files.

# Details:
- Federated_Learning.ipynb : Federated Learning of 5 nodes (Experiment 1)
- Federated_Learning_rolling.ipynb : Federated Learning of 5 nodes with successive increment of dataset (Experiment 2)
- Normal_Learning.ipynb : Normal/Conventional Learning of a single model
- Quantized_federal_learning.pynb : To quantized the global model obtained.
